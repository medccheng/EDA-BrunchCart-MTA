    "The goal of this project is to help a friend create business operations plan that is location based for a mobile Brunch Cart in the NYC Financial District. I used the MTA Turnstile data to help identify which subway station in the Financial district area has the highest foot traffic during the weekdays. After identifying the top subway station in the Financial District, I filtered and cleaned the whole data set which I then used to build a couple of visualizations. The charts created were used to further understand the weekday foot traffic data on a specific station for a particular period of time. "

    "The dataset contains (4 hour interval) records from May 2021 to July 2021 with 11 columns for each row: 7 columns are categorical; 2 are numerical; and 2 are ordinal or datetime type. A couple of columns represent register values of entry/exit for a particular combination of columns. To limit the scope of this project, I only used the entry register values and ignored the exit register values. Furthermore, 7 individual columns were grouped into more general categories, while the date and time columns were used to extract more useful categorical fields like 'Day of the Week' and 'AM/PM'.\n",
